Wrapper Function for PyCURL with Requests Syntax

# Introduction
I was looking for a low level approach to managing python requests and simple to implement. 
Python Requests is by far the most popular and easiest to use. It always works as intended but can prove unreliable in terms of performance.
PyCURL is a great wrapper for the Curl library for Unix systems and it provides access and control of requests. It has greater performance compared to Python Requests but isnt easy to implement. It also provides support for other protocols like FTP / SSH and more

My intention is to make a simple library that marries the two and provides the best of both worlds.

# Installation
To install, you require 'requests' and 'pycurl' libraries.
'pip3 install curl_req'

# Usage

# Performance
